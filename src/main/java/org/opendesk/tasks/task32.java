	A game for one player is played on a board consisting of N consecutive squares, numbered from 0 to N − 1. There is a number written on each square. A non-empty array A of N integers contains the numbers written on the squares. Moreover, some squares can be marked during the game.
	At the beginning of the game, there is a pebble on square number 0 and this is the only square on the board which is marked. The goal of the game is to move the pebble to square number N − 1.
	During each turn we throw a six-sided die, with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces, and consider the number K, which shows on the upper face after the die comes to rest. Then we move the pebble standing on square number I to square number I + K, providing that square number I + K exists. If square number I + K does not exist, we throw the die again until we obtain a valid move. Finally, we mark square number I + K.
	After the game finishes (when the pebble is standing on square number N − 1), we calculate the result. The result of the game is the sum of the numbers written on all marked squares.

	For example, given the following array:
		A[0] = 1
		A[1] = -2
		A[2] = 0
		A[3] = 9
		A[4] = -1
		A[5] = -2
	one possible game could be as follows:

	the pebble is on square number 0, which is marked;
	we throw 3; the pebble moves from square number 0 to square number 3; we mark square number 3;
	we throw 5; the pebble does not move, since there is no square number 8 on the board;
	we throw 2; the pebble moves to square number 5; we mark this square and the game ends.
	The marked squares are 0, 3 and 5, so the result of the game is 1 + 9 + (−2) = 8. This is the maximal possible result that can be achieved on this board.

	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
	that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximal result that can be achieved on the board represented by array A.

	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
	each element of array A is an integer within the range [−10,000..10,000].

	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/
