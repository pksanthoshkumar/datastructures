package org.opendesk.tasks;/*	Brackets
	Determine whether a given string of parentheses (multiple types) is properly nested.
	Task Score 100%, Correctness 100%, Performance 100%

	A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if any of the following conditions is true:
	S is empty;
	S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
	S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.

	For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.

	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(String S); }
	that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

	For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.

	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
	string S consists only of the following characters: "(", "{", "[", "]", "}" and/or ")".

	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/
