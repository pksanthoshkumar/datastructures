package org.opendesk.tasks;/*	NumberOfDiscIntersections
	Compute the number of intersections in a sequence of discs.
	Task Score 100%, Correctness 100%, Performance 100%
	
	We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

	We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).

	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
	that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
	each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].

	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/

/*  First we create two arrays of starting points (where a disc intersects

    x-axe on the right). Then we sort theese arrays, so we don't depend on
    radiuses or centers.
    Then we iterate through both arrays and add intersections of lower end
