	Given array of integers, find the lowest absolute sum of elements.
	Task Score 100%, Correctness 100%, Performance 100%

	For a given array A of N integers and a sequence S of N integers from the set {−1, 1}, we define val(A, S) as follows:
	val(A, S) = |sum{ A[i]*S[i] for i = 0..N−1 }|
	(Assume that the sum of zero elements equals zero.)
	For a given array A, we are looking for such a sequence S that minimizes val(A,S).

	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
	that, given an array A of N integers, computes the minimum value of val(A,S) from all possible values of val(A,S) for all possible sequences S of N integers from the set {−1, 1}.

	For example, given array:
	  A[0] =  1
	  A[1] =  5
	  A[2] =  2
	  A[3] = -2
	your function should return 0, since for S = [−1, 1, −1, 1], val(A, S) = 0, which is the minimum possible value.

	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [0..20,000];
	each element of array A is an integer within the range [−100..100].

	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*max(abs(A))2);
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(N+sum(abs(A))) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/
