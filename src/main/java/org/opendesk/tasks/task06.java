	A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. Array A represents numbers on a tape.
	Any integer P, such that 0 < P < N, splits this tape into two non-empty parts: A[0], A[1], ..., A[P − 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N − 1].
	The difference between the two parts is the value of: |(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P − 1]) − (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N − 1])|
	In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.

	For example, consider array A such that:

	  A[0] = 3
	  A[1] = 1
	  A[2] = 2
	  A[3] = 4
	  A[4] = 3
	We can split this tape in four places:

	P = 1, difference = |3 − 10| = 7 
	P = 2, difference = |4 − 9| = 5 
	P = 3, difference = |6 − 7| = 1 
	P = 4, difference = |10 − 3| = 7 
	Write a function:

	Assume that:

	N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
	each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
	Complexity:

	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/
