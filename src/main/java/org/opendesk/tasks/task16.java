	Maximize A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R).
	Task Score 100%, Correctness 100%, Performance 100%

	A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).
	Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
	that, given a non-empty array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.

	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
	each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].

	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/
