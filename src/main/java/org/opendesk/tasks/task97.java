package org.opendesk.tasks;/*  A vending machine has the following denominations: 1c, 5c, 10c, 25c, 50c, and $1.
    Your task is to write a program that will be used in a vending machine to return change.
    Assume that the vending machine will always want to return the least number of coins or notes.
    Devise a function getChange(M, P) where M is how much money was inserted into the machine
    and P the price of the item selected, that returns an array of integers representing the number of
    each denomination to return.
    Example:
    getChange(5, 0.99) should return [1,0,0,0,0,4]  */
