	Determine whether a given string of parentheses (single type) is properly nested.
	Task Score 100%, Correctness 100%, Performance 100%
	
	A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:
	S is empty;
	S has the form "(U)" where U is a properly nested string;
	S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.

	For example, string "(()(())())" is properly nested but string "())" isn't.

	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(String S); }
	that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if string S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000];
	string S consists only of the characters "(" and/or ")".

	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).	*/
